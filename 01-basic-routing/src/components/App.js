// NOTE:
// The History API is an object that lets us manage the current location via history.location as well as previous locations. Think of the location property of the object as an array. The current location is the last item on the array and we manipulate the array through methods such as history.push() orhistory.replace. Whatever manipulation is made on the array will trigger a page transition to the current location. This is what happens behind the scene when using Link and Redirect component as weâ€™ll see soon.
